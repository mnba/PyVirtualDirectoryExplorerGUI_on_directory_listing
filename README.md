## PyVirtualDirectoryExplorer_on_ls_dir_listing
This is **Virtual Directory Explorer app** (simple app), written with Python2 + wxWidgets.

* Takes for input recursive directory listing from either:
 * Linux/Unix 'ls -laR' command output or 
 * Windows 'dir /s' command output and 
* Provides GUI browser for it, the graphical interface to browse/explore the given virtual directory.

It can be considered as **_Directory structure snapshot viewer / browser_**.

Even entire disk filesystem structure can be examined.

###Supported Operating systems: Windows, Macos, Linux
This software supports all major Desktop Operating systems. Only support for Python 2.7 and wxWidgets 2.9+ is required.

### Designed-in Limitations

Since input does not contain other info besides directory/filesystem structure and metainformation generated by dir /s of ls -laR command, it doesn't contain other information such as content of the files, so the browser can't show or provide them.

This is in the first head *directory **structure** snapshot browser*.
